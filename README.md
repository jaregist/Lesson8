## Bugs/Things To Fix
1. Editing my auctions don't seem to be working properly. When viewing "My Auctions" and clicking the edit/pencil icon, it brings me to a page that states "Auction Starts at Invalid Date" even when the auction is live and appears to work elsewhere. It should bring me to a page with the ability to edit the auction details.
